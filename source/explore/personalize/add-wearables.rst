Put On Wearables
###################################

You can customize your avatar's appearance by adding wearables, such as a pirate's hat, a pair of sunglasses, or even a pair of trousers that you designed. Like avatars, you can use your imagination to create your own.

-----------------------------
Wear Your Own Wearable
-----------------------------

Put on a :doc:`wearable that you created <../../create/wearables>`. All wearables must be hosted on the internet before they can be used with Overte. You can host on your own HTTP(S) server, upload to your website or to another web hosting service.

.. note:: Your wearable must be hosted at a publicly accessible URL so everyone can see it. You must be able to link directly to the file on the internet; Do not use an url to a download page, local network address or a file on your local computer.

Once you know the URL for your wearable's FBX/GLB/gLTX/OBJ file, then put it on your avatar:

1. In Interface, pull up your tablet or HUD and click on **Avatar**.
2. In the **Avatar** window, click the hat icon next to 'Wearables'.

3. Click 'Add custom' at the top of the window.
4. Enter the avatar file's URL and click 'Confirm'.
5. Select the joint you'd like to use for your wearable. For example, a hat would be on your head, and fairy wings would be on your spine.
6. Fine tune the placement using the 'Position' and 'Rotation' options.
7. Check 'Is soft' if the item is rigged with your skeleton. This allows the item to move and bend with the avatar as it moves.
8. Click 'Save'.

.. note:: You may find it easier to fine tune your wearable's placement `using the Create app <#modify-your-wearable>`_.

--------------------------------
Grab your Wearable
--------------------------------

A wearable isn't just a static add-on to your avatar, it behaves as if it were its own object in the world too. In VR you can use either hand to grab and interact with it, just as you can on Desktop.

You can make small adjustments to their position using your hand controllers. Want to spin your cap around to be one of the cool kids? Now you can! It will stay connected to whichever joint you chose when you added it, but will maintain its new relative position after you have released it from your grab.

.. note:: Wearables can be grabbed by anyone, not just the person wearing them. If you don't want that, make sure to lock them in place!

If you would like to lock it in place, so it cannot be grabbed, click the lock icon in the **Avatar** app.

--------------------------------
Modify your Wearable
--------------------------------

You can even modify your wearable using the `Create app <../../create/tools.html#the-create-app>`_ whilst you are wearing it.

.. note:: Modified wearables will follow you to different domains and remain when you next load Overte, however any modifications will not be saved to your avatar until you favourite it again.

You can edit any property of your wearable, just like any other object in the domain. Give it a name, shift its position in relation the joint it is attached to, give it an animation or attach an entity script. Your modifications will remain until you switch avatar.

----------------------------------------
Favourite Wearables for your Avatar
----------------------------------------

So you have added a wearable or two as accessories for your current avatar, and you like them so much you just know you will be wearing them all the time? It's time to save them as a set with your favourite avatar.

When you add an Avatar as a favourite, it will also save any wearables you have added along with it. So whenever you change your set of wearables be sure to press **Add to favorites** to save them as a favourite set. Then whenever you load it from your favourites again, your wearables will load along with it!

.. note:: Changes made to your wearables are not automatically saved to your favourites. You must **Add to favorites** again to save changes after grabbing, modifying, adding or removing wearables.
