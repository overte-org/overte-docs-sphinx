# Install Tablet Apps

You can enhance your experience in Overte by installing tablet apps. These apps enable you to get more out of Overte. Do you want to record your avatar dancing, take selfies, or finger paint? Or are you looking to pose yourself or make your avatar clap? There's a number of apps that can help you customize your experience in-world.

If you can't find an app for what you'd like to do, you can [create your own](../../create/applications). You can easily [load your own application as a script](../../script/get-started-with-scripting#running-scripts-window), or add it to our [Community Apps](https://github.com/overte-org/community-apps) to make it available to everyone via the More app.

## Install Tablet Apps

We and many users have created tablet apps that are available in Overte. To find and install an app:

1. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **More**.
2. Search for a specific app, or browse all apps.
3. Once you find the app of your choice, click 'Install' to start using the app in Overte.
4. Once the app is installed, you can access the app through your HUD or Tablet.


## Update an App

Apps installed through the more app, and indeed any scripts loaded from URL, do not need to be updated manually. When Interface loads it will automatically check for updates and install them, so you don't need to worry about keeping up to date!

## More Apps

Below are some examples of the apps available in the More app and how you can use them. This is not an exhaustive list; you will find many more in More app!

### Spectator Camera

The Spectator Camera is a camera you can use to record or livestream what you and your friends do in Overte. It is only available in HMD mode, and requires a recording software such as [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/) to work correctly. Check out their [official overview guide](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/official-overview-guide.402/) for more details.

[Use the instructions above](#install-tablet-apps) to install the Spectator Camera app.

    <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
    <p>While using the Spectator Camera, Interface's framerate might be affected. This is because Interface is rendering not only what you see, but what the Spectator Camera sees as well. </p>
</div>

To use the Spectator Camera app:
1. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Spectator**.
2. Turn on your Spectator Cam by moving the slider. You'll see the camera appear in-world. By default, the app's display shows you what you see in VR through your HMD. This is to show you what you're recording without having to take off your HMD. ![](_images/spec-cam-window.png)
3. To record yourself, switch your display from your HMD's view to the camera view. This lets you record videos of yourself, such as your avatar dancing or trying on different wearables.
4. Enable switching views with your controllers in the **Spectator** app on your HUD or Tablet.
    * **Rift**: If you're using Oculus Touch controllers, click the left thumbstick to switch views.
    * **Vive**: If you're using HTC Vive controllers, press on the center of the thumb pad to switch views.

### Body Paint

The Body Paint app lets your paint your environment, your own avatar, or even another user's avatar. [Use the instructions above](#install-tablet-apps) to install the Fingerpaint app.

To use the Body Paint app:
1. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Body Paint**.
2. First, click 'Options' to select what you would like to paint on - the world around you, your avatar, or another user's avatar (with their permission).
3. Click 'Palette' to select a color for your paint.
4. Click 'Brushes' to select the settings for your brush, such as stroke width, type of brush, and special effects.
