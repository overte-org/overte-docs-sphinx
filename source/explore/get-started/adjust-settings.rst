Adjust Your Settings

You can adjust various settings in Overte so that it runs to your preferences. Many of these settings are changed using the HUD (in Desktop mode) or Tablet (in VR mode).

------------------
The Tablet and HUD
------------------

In VR, all of your settings are found in your **Tablet**. The Tablet also gives you easy access to any :doc:`apps that you install <../personalize/install-apps>`. Pull up the tablet by clicking the menu button on your controller.

In Desktop Mode, rather than the tablet you have a smaller version called the "Heads-up Display" or HUD. It contains the exact same options as the Tablet (settings, apps, etc), but it takes up less space on your screen. if you would rather, you have the option to use the Tablet instead just like in VR. To enable the Tablet, first enable the **Developer** menu by going to **Settings > Developer Menu**. Then, go to **Developer > UI > Desktop Tablet Becomes Toolbar** and toggle it off.

---------------------
Enter or Exit VR Mode
---------------------

You can enjoy Overte with or without VR equipment such as head mounted displays (HMD), hand controllers and audio headsets. Our Desktop mode contains many of Overte's features such as audio, basic movements and gestures, and the ability to travel to different domains.

Keep in mind, however, that the most immersive and powerful experience is when you use VR equipment. Only then will you be able to interact with people in 3D, track body movements, and easily engage with the objects around you. Once you have set up your VR equipment, you can easily switch between VR mode and Desktop mode.

.. note:: In order to use VR you must launch Overte straight into VR first, as Overte will not load VR plugins unnecessarily for desktop users. Once you have launched into VR, you will be able to switch between VR and Desktop mode with ease.

To switch between Desktop and VR mode, you can select it from the Display menu. The menu can be found at the top of your screen when in desktop mode, or on your **Tablet** in VR. Click the **Display** menu, then select your desktop or VR device.

You can choose how you view things around you by changing your perspective. To change your perspective:
