Bring Visitors to Your Domain
#############################

Now that you have a domain up and running, its time to invite people in to your domain and create your community in the virtual world. Here are some ways to bring more visitors in to your domain.

    :depth: 2

-------------------
Invite Your Friends 
-------------------

Nothing is more inviting than a personal invitation to come check out an exciting, new place in the metaverse! Invite your friends with a personal message to visit your domain. 

Share your domain by giving out its IP address or place name. Anyone with an Overte account can enter the place name directly into the Places app to find it, or use a hifi:// address with either your IP address or place name to teleport directly to your domain.

.. note:: TIP: You can send other Overte users hifi:// addresses which send them directly to a location in your domain. Simply click "Navigate" -> "Copy Address to clipboard" and send them the address. When they paste the address into their Places app they will be instantly teleported to where you were when you copied the address.

----------------------------------------------
Add Your Domain to the Places App
----------------------------------------------

The Places app is designed to advertise public domains across Overte.

You can connect your Domain by following the instructions during the initial setup wizard, and it will automatically appear in the Places app.

If you decide not to connect it during setup, you can do so later:

1. Go to your domain's web Dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Network/Directory services
2. Click connect and follow the instructions
4. Your Domain will soon appear in the Places App (maybe 15 minutes or so)

If you would like to edit your Place you can do so at `Overte Directory Service <mv.overte.org/dashboard/home>`_ under *Places*.

You may want to open your domain to the public, such as being open to logged in users or everyone. This means that, in your Domain Settings, under 'Standard Permissions', either the 'anonymous' or 'logged-in' group must have the Connect permission.

To restrict access to your domain, you will need to create a blocklist of users without permission to connect to your domain. This can be set up by username, IP address, MAC address or machine fingerprint.

------------------------------------------
Promote Your Community Event with Overte
------------------------------------------

To get your event or experience added to the calendar on our website, you can submit it to us by joining us on `Matrix <https://matrix.to/#/#overte:overte.org>`_ or `Discord <https://discord.gg/4YuQvc8K2f>`_ and reaching out in the events channel.

It will then be:

* Added to Overte's `Events Calendar <https://www.overte.org/events>`_ 
* Promoted on Overte's social channels

--------------------
Blast to Connections
--------------------

If you want to let all of your Overte colleagues know about something that’s happening right now, you can blast an announcement to all of your connections. Within about a minute, all of your interested `connections and friends <../explore/socialize.html#make-connections-and-friends>`_ will get notified whenever they come online. 

To send a blast notification: 

1. Take a snapshot of your domain. 

    * In Interface, pull up your Tablet or HUD and go to **Snap**.
    * In the Snapshot app, press the large red circle to capture a snapshot.
2. Choose to 'Share: Blast to Connections'.

When a friend or connection clicks on the notification, it will open the GoTo app with your snapshot available. Clicking on the snapshot will take them directly to the place where the picture was taken within the metaverse.  

---------------------------------------------
Post a Snapshot on Social Media
---------------------------------------------

You can also share your domain directly to Twitter or Facebook. To do so:

1. Take a snapshot of your domain. 

    * In Interface, pull up your Tablet or HUD and go to **Snap**.
    * In the Snapshot app, press the large red circle to capture a snapshot.
2. Choose to 'Share to Facebook' or 'Share to Twitter'.
3. Log in to your social media account.

When someone clicks the story in their Facebook or Twitter feed, they are taken to a page that gives them more info about the domain. Clicking the picture or “visit” button on that page will bring them to the place where the picture was taken within the metaverse (if they have Interface installed).
