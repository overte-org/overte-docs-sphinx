Bring Visitors to Your Domain
#############################

Now that you have a domain up and running, its time to invite people in to your domain and create your community in the virtual world. Here are some ways to bring more visitors in to your domain.

-------------------
Invite Your Friends 
-------------------

Nothing is more inviting than a personal invitation to come check out an exciting, new place in the metaverse! Invite your friends with a personal message to visit your domain. 

Share your domain by giving out its IP address or place name. Anyone with a Overte account can enter the IP address or place name directly into the GoTo app to teleport directly to your domain.

.. note:: TIP: You can send other Overte users clickable URLs that send them directly to your domain. Simply send them the URL ``https://hifi.place/<domain IP | place name>``. When they click the link, they will be prompted to open Interface.exe and land at the spawn point in your domain.

----------------------------------------------
Add Your Domain to the Explore App
----------------------------------------------

The Explore app is designed to advertise public domains across the metaverse.

In order to be featured on Overte's Explore app, you must add a location marker by opening the app and going to the spot in your domain that you want people to spawn at. In your app, scroll to the bottom and click the "Add Location" button, fill it out and you should be set! You may want to open your domain to the public, such as being open to logged in users or everyone. This means that, in your Domain Settings, under 'Standard Permissions', either the 'anonymous' or 'logged-in' group must have the Connect permission.

To restrict access to your domain, you will need to create a blacklist of users without permission to connect to your domain. This can be set up by username, IP address, MAC address or machine fingerprint.

------------------------------------------
Promote Your Community Event with Overte
------------------------------------------

To get your event or experience added to the calendar on our website, you can submit it to us by filling out by joining our `Discord<https://discordapp.com/invite/Pvx2vke>` server and reaching out to a Core Team Member.

It will then be:
