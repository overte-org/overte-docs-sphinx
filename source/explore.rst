Overte is a virtual worlds software which connects you to places created by other people. Each world in Overte is its own Domain, and there can be many Places to visit in each one. You can meet people, attend events, visit friends' places and even create at their place or within your own domain.

If it's your first time using Overte, you'll start your journey in a local tutorial space by yourself, where you can experiment with the controls and learn about the Interface. When you are ready, try exploring other domains using the Places app and socialize with people. If you've visited Overte before, you will return to the location where you last visited.

Throughout this chapter, learn how to make the most of your exploration:
